# WordPress & phpMyAdmin Docker Compose Setup

This project sets up a WordPress website along with a phpMyAdmin interface using Docker Compose. The setup includes three services: WordPress, phpMyAdmin, and MariaDB as the database server. This README provides a guide on how to get started with the project, including installation, configuration, and usage.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

Make sure that Docker is running and accessible from your command line.

## Project Structure

The project directory contains the following files and directories:

```plaintext
.
├── docker-compose.yml
├── README.md
└── secrets
    └── password.txt
```

- **docker-compose.yml**: The main configuration file for Docker Compose.
- **README.md**: This documentation file.
- **secrets/password.txt**: A file containing the database password, used as a Docker secret.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
   ```

2. **Prepare the Secrets File**:
   - Create a file named `password.txt` inside the `secrets` directory.
   - Add a strong password to the file. This password will be used for the MariaDB root and WordPress database user.

   ```plaintext
   your_secure_password_here
   ```

3. **Ensure Directories for Volumes**:
   - Create directories on your host machine for persistent storage.

   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /srv/wordpress
   sudo mkdir -p /srv/mariadb
   ```

   - Set the appropriate permissions to ensure Docker has access:

   ```bash
   sudo chown -R 1000:1000 /srv/wordpress
   sudo chown -R 1001:1001 /srv/mariadb
   ```

## Configuration

### docker-compose.yml

The `docker-compose.yml` file is configured to run three services:

- **WordPress**:
  - Image: `wordpress:6.3`
  - Ports: `8080` on the host to `80` on the container.
  - Environment variables for database configuration are passed via Docker secrets.

- **phpMyAdmin**:
  - Image: `phpmyadmin:latest`
  - Ports: `8081` on the host to `80` on the container.
  - Connects to MariaDB using the provided environment variables.

- **MariaDB**:
  - Image: `mariadb:10.5`
  - Uses secrets for secure credential storage.
  - Stores data persistently using a Docker volume mapped to `/srv/mariadb`.

### Secrets

The secrets mechanism ensures that sensitive information, like database passwords, is not exposed in the environment variables.

- **Secrets File**: Located at `secrets/password.txt`.

### Network

The setup uses a custom Docker network named `wpnet` with a bridge driver to allow inter-service communication.

## Usage

### Starting the Services

To start the services, run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

- **-d**: Runs the containers in detached mode.

### Accessing WordPress

Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to access the WordPress installation page.

### Accessing phpMyAdmin

To manage your database via phpMyAdmin, go to `http://localhost:8081`.

### Stopping the Services

To stop the running containers, use:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

This command stops and removes all containers defined in the `docker-compose.yml`.

## Troubleshooting

### Cannot Access WordPress or phpMyAdmin

- **Ports**: Ensure ports 8080 and 8081 are not being used by other services.
- **Containers Running**: Verify that all containers are running with:

  ```bash
  docker-compose ps
  ```

- **Check Logs**: Examine container logs for errors:

  ```bash
  docker-compose logs -f
  ```

### Database Connection Errors

- **Secrets File**: Ensure the password in `secrets/password.txt` is correct.
- **Network**: Verify that the containers are connected to the `wpnet` network.

### Permissions Issues

- **Volumes**: Ensure that the `/srv/wordpress` and `/srv/mariadb` directories have the correct permissions.

### Common Docker Issues

- **Remove Unused Docker Data**:

  If you face issues related to disk space or stale containers, you can clean up your Docker environment:

  ```bash
  docker system prune -a
  ```

  Note: This will remove all unused containers, networks, and images.

## Additional Information

### Docker Compose File Explanation

Here's a brief explanation of the main sections in the `docker-compose.yml` file:

- **version**: Specifies the version of the Docker Compose file format.
- **services**: Defines the individual services that make up the application.
  - **wordpress**: Runs the official WordPress image and connects it to the MariaDB database using environment variables and Docker secrets.
  - **phpmyadmin**: Provides a web interface for managing the MariaDB database.
  - **mariadb**: Runs the official MariaDB image, storing data in a persistent volume.
- **networks**: Sets up a custom Docker network for communication between containers.
- **secrets**: Securely manages sensitive information like passwords.

### Security Considerations

- **Use Strong Passwords**: Ensure the password in `secrets/password.txt` is strong and unique.
- **SSL/TLS**: Consider using SSL/TLS for secure communication between the host and the containers, especially in a production environment.
